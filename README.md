# Supplier Risk Assessment Project

## Overview

The Supplier Risk Assessment Project focuses on evaluating and ranking suppliers based on various risk factors such as delivery delays, quality issues, and pricing volatility. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, this model aids in proactive risk management and the selection of reliable suppliers, ensuring a more resilient and efficient supply chain.

## Features

- **Risk Assessment**: Analyzes suppliers based on delivery performance, quality metrics, and pricing stability.
- **Ranking System**: Provides a clear ranking of suppliers according to their assessed risk levels.
- **Proactive Management**: Helps in identifying and mitigating potential supply chain disruptions.

## Techniques Used

- **Decision Trees**: Used for understanding and visualizing the decision-making process in supplier risk assessment.
- **Random Forest**: Enhances prediction accuracy by combining multiple decision trees to evaluate supplier risk.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM)**: Utilized for classification tasks to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk suppliers.
